To compile: 
make

To run scanner:
java -cp {path to java_cup.jar}:. Scanner < {path to filename}
ex. java -cp java-cup.jar:. Scanner < test/1.cm

To run Parser and print AST to file:
java -cp {path to java_cup.jar}:. Main {path to filename} -a file.abs
ex. java -cp java-cup.jar:. Main test/1.cm -a 1.abs

To run semantic parsing and print both the AST and Symbol table
java -cp {path to java_cup.jar}:. Main {path to filename} 
ex. java -cp java-cup.jar:. Main test/1.cm 

To run semantic parsing and print the symbol table to an output file
java -cp {path to java_cup.jar}:. Main {path to filename} -s file.sym
ex. java -cp java-cup.jar:. Main test/1.cm -s 1.sym

To clean:
make clean

Test files are found in the symTest folder. They are described in the documentation.
However, I will repeat the expected output here:
1.cm: successfully output a symbol table, no errors.
2.cm: Will produce an error for redefining a variable and for using an undefined variable. Another error is from having no main function
3.cm: Will produce an error for defining a variable as void. Another will be produced by the return statement because it returns an int but the function declaration states a boolean will be returned
4.cm: Will produce an error for the if condition because it is not Boolean. Another will be produces from the index because it is not an int.
5.cm: Will produce and error for the wrong type of arguments in a function call. Another for assigning an int to a bool variable. Another for trying to add a boolean and an int. Another for trying to assign that invalid operation to an int variable. And finally, the Main function is not at the end of the function.

Notes:
The makefile uses cup.ordered but there are other cup files included in my submission. As mentioned above, if you do not include command line arguments then both the AST and the symbol table will be printed. include -s if you want it just to be printed to a file. 
- Only one command line argument can be used at once, only -a or -s.
- output file must be deleted before it can be overwritten.
